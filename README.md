## 📌 Executive Summary

The **VANTA Three-Node Brain** is a **production-grade, multi-node capital intelligence system** designed for resiliency, auditability, and scale.  
It separates responsibilities into three dedicated roles:

- **Alpha** → Orchestrator & Control Plane (truth source, trackers, operator tools)  
- **Markets** → High-throughput ingestion & reflection (signals, conviction, reason vectors)  
- **Executor** → Deterministic trade routing, vault enforcement, broker adapters  

This separation ensures:
- **Security** → No single node carries full state.  
- **Replayability** → Any decision path can be reconstructed.  
- **Scale** → Collector and executor capacity grows independently.  
- **Governance** → Vault overlays, personas, and flip-modes constrain execution.  

---

## 🎯 Scope

This LLD documents the **operational architecture** of VANTA across its three nodes:
- Topology & roles  
- Filesystem layout  
- Data flows (harvest → reflect → queue → execute → audit)  
- Personas & overlays (where applied)  
- Observability, risk controls, and operator UX  

---

## 🚫 Non-Scope

Not included in this document:
- Proprietary model architectures (classifiers, forecasters, embeddings)  
- Prompt templates or inference logic  
- Live broker credentials, API keys, or tenant-specific configs  
- Platform-side subscription & mirroring (documented in **VANTA Platform LLD**)  

---

## 🗺️ Topology (Authoritative)

The VANTA brain is deployed as a **three-node distributed system**. Each node has a precise, non-overlapping role, ensuring separation of duties and fault tolerance.

### Node A - **Blackglass-Alpha (Orchestrator / Brain)**
- Acts as the **control plane** and authoritative configuration source.  
- Hosts the **assistant, tracker, and diagnostics suite** used by operators.  
- Maintains the **registry of vaults, overlays, and thread metadata**.  
- Exports a shared `/opt/vanta/build` directory via NFS to Markets and Executor.  

### Node B - **Vanta-Markets (Harvest & Reflection)**
- Handles **high-throughput collection and reflection** of signals: Reddit, Twitter, SEC, news, crypto, options flow.  
- Normalizes, deduplicates, and aligns raw feeds.  
- Computes **reason vectors, conviction scores, and market overlays**.  
- Produces authoritative artifacts like `trade_signals.json` and reflection logs.  

### Node C - **Vanta-Executor (Execution Plane)**
- Consumes **autotrade_queue.json** as the canonical intent stream.  
- Routes orders through **risk fences, vault overlays, and persona constraints**.  
- Interfaces with brokers/exchanges via pluggable adapters (Alpaca, Tradier, Coinbase, IBKR, Bybit).  
- Maintains **open_orders.json** and append-only `trade_log.jsonl` for replay.  

---

### Cross-Node Principles
- **Separation of Concerns:** no single node contains ingestion + reflection + execution.  
- **Shared Utilities:** Alpha distributes assistants/tools via NFS, ensuring all nodes run consistent binaries.  
- **Local State:** each node owns its `/opt/vanta/memory` and `/opt/vanta/logs` directories; nothing critical is centralized.  
- **Governance Layer:** vault overlays and persona biases flow across nodes but remain deterministic.  
- **Auditability:** append-only logs exist per node; together, they reconstruct every decision path.  

---

## 📂 Filesystem & Layout (Hardened, Repeatable)

The VANTA filesystem is designed for **clarity, repeatability, and audit-first operations**.  
Every node follows a consistent `/opt/vanta/` structure, with node-specific subdirectories.

---

### Common (all nodes)
- `/opt/vanta/build/` → shared utilities & assistants (from Alpha export)  
  - `vanta_assistant.py` → interactive ops agent  
  - `vanta_diagnostics.py` → system health + metrics  
  - `vanta_thread.py` → thread tracker + orchestrator  
  - `modules/` → under-review modules, isolated  
  - `logs/` → assistant and tracker logs  
  - `venv/` → optional virtualenv for shared tools  

- `/opt/vanta/tools/` → node-local operational tools  
- `/opt/vanta/memory/` → live JSON/JSONL state (queues, signals, overlays)  
- `/opt/vanta/logs/` → operational logs (rotated, append-only)  

---

### Node A - Blackglass-Alpha
- `/opt/vanta/alpha/`  
  - `thread_tracker.json` → authoritative tracker for modules & reviews  
  - `tracker_manager.py`, `tracker_viewer.py`, `tracker_status_summary.py` → management tools  
- **NFS Export:** `/opt/vanta/build` → mounted by Markets & Executor  
- **Aliases:** `vanta-assistant`, `vanta-thread`, `vanta-diagnostics`, `vanta-run`  
- **Shortcuts:** `vt-add`, `vt-list`, `vt-mark`, `vt-open`, `vt-note`, `vt-fix`  

---

### Node B - Vanta-Markets
- `/opt/vanta/markets/`  
  - Harvesters: `reddit_stealth.py`, `twitter_*`, `sec_scraper.py`, `news_signals.py`, `crypto_signals.py`  
  - Reflector: `market_reflector.py` → merges feeds into conviction vectors  
  - Reranker: `signal_reranker.py` → applies fallback stability & persona bias  
- `/opt/vanta/memory/`  
  - `trade_signals.json` → core convictions  
  - `*_signals.json` → reddit/news/crypto/etc. feeds  
  - `system_belief.json`, `signal_leaderboard.json` → meta reasoning  
- `/opt/vanta/logs/`  
  - `reflector_meta.log`, `reddit.log`, `vanta-daily-runtime.log`  

---

### Node C - Vanta-Executor
- `/opt/vanta/executor/`  
  - `trade_executor.py` → main order router  
- `/opt/vanta/memory/`  
  - `autotrade_queue.json` → manager intents  
  - `open_orders.json`, `trade_log.jsonl` → execution results  
  - `vault.json` → alloc rules, persona overlays, tier bands  
  - `vault_overlay.json` → feature flags, maintenance, flip mode  
- Broker adapters (pluggable, no keys in repo): Alpaca, Tradier, IBKR, Coinbase, Bybit  

---

### Design Principles
- **Alpha = authoritative control**  
- **Markets = collection + reflection**  
- **Executor = routing + broker adapters**  
- Each node’s `/memory/` + `/logs/` is append-only and replayable  
- Assistants and utilities flow one-way from Alpha → workers via `/opt/vanta/build`  

---

## 💾 Storage & Sync (Simple, Proven, Restart-Safe)

The VANTA stack uses a **minimal but robust storage design**.  
Authoritative data lives locally per node, while shared utilities flow from Alpha.

---

### 🔗 Shared Mount
- **Alpha exports:** `/opt/vanta/build`  
- **Markets/Executor mount:** `/opt/vanta/build` (via NFS, versioned & read-only)  

This ensures workers always run the same assistant and tracker bundle distributed from Alpha.

---

### 📂 Local State
Each node persists its own **state & logs**:
- `/opt/vanta/memory/` → JSON/JSONL state (signals, queues, overlays, orders).  
- `/opt/vanta/logs/` → append-only logs, rotated daily.  
- Node-local memory is **never overwritten** by NFS.  

---

### 🔑 Config Source of Truth
- `thread_tracker.json` (Alpha) → authoritative record of modules, reviews, and statuses.  
- `vault.json` + `vault_overlay.json` → manager intent + overrides (synced manually or scripted).  

---

### 🛡️ Design Principles
- **Isolation:** each node owns its memory; corruption is contained.  
- **Auditability:** append-only JSONL logs guarantee replay.  
- **Determinism:** utilities and assistants stay identical across nodes (NFS export).  
- **Resilience:** restart-safe; services resume state cleanly from `/memory/`.  

---

## ⏱️ Runtime & Scheduling

VANTA services are supervised by **systemd** and lightweight cron jobs.  
This ensures resilience, restart-safety, and predictable cycles across nodes.

---

### ⚙️ Systemd Units
- **Alpha (control plane):**
  - `vanta-assistant@.service` → interactive ops agent on demand.  
- **Markets (reflection):**
  - `markets-reflector.service` → runs reflection cycles deterministically.  
- **Executor (execution):**
  - `executor-router.service` → tails `autotrade_queue.json` and routes orders.  

> All services are designed as **stateless wrappers**, resuming cleanly from `/opt/vanta/memory/`.

---

### 🗓️ Cron Scheduling
- **Markets Node**
  - `* * * * *` → optional light collectors (Reddit/Twitter).  
  - `15 9 * * 1-5` → reflection warm-up for trading hours.  
  - `@hourly` → deeper collectors (e.g., SEC filings, sentiment).  

- **Executor Node**
  - `* * * * *` → sweeps `autotrade_queue.json`, dispatches orders.  

---

### 🛑 Kill Switches
- Controlled via `vault_overlay.json`.  
  - `"maintenance": true` → freezes all new dispatches.  
  - Granular flags available:  
    - **Orders disabled**  
    - **External calls disabled**  
    - **Full halt**

---

### ✅ Design Benefits
- **Idempotent:** reruns never double-fire thanks to JSON state machines.  
- **Safe:** kill switches guarantee guardrails under stress.  
- **Efficient:** cron + systemd balance lightweight triggers with persistent services.  
- **Transparent:** every action logged and replayable.  

---

## 🔒 Networking & Security

VANTA is hardened with **minimal surface area** and strict role separation.  
Only essential ports and paths are exposed; all secrets are externalized.

---

### 🌐 Minimal Ports
- **NFS** → internal only (Alpha → workers).  
- **SSH** → restricted management jump host.  
- **Egress** → whitelisted APIs (brokers, curated news/social feeds).  

---

### 🛡️ Hardening
- **Exports** → limited to VPC/internal ranges; no broad access.  
- **Service accounts** → least-privilege; sudoers minimized.  
- **Secrets** → never stored in code; referenced via secure paths or vault services.  
- **Broker/API keys** → root-only files or secrets manager, never in repo.  

---

### 🚨 Governance
- **Audit-first design** → all external calls and order paths append to logs.  
- **Immutable records** → append-only storage ensures replayability.  
- **Kill switches** → immediate halts for brokers, vaults, or whole system.  

---

### ✅ Design Benefits
- **Regulatory-grade security** → aligns with enterprise network policy.  
- **Fail-safe defaults** → no open access, all denied unless explicitly whitelisted.  
- **Operational clarity** → easy to review, export, and audit.  

---

## 🔄 Data Flow (Wire-Level Narrative)

The VANTA brain operates as a **deterministic pipeline** — every step auditable, replayable, and governed.

---

### 1. Harvest (Markets Node)
- Collectors ingest raw signals: Reddit, Twitter, SEC filings, news feeds, crypto flows.  
- Normalize, deduplicate, timestamp-align.  
- Outputs → `*_signals.json` in local memory.  

---

### 2. Reflect (Markets Node)
- **market_reflector.py** merges shards → conviction vectors + reason vectors.  
- **signal_reranker.py** enforces stability, applies persona weights.  
- Writes canonical `trade_signals.json`.  

---

### 3. Queue (Promotion Step)
- Eligible signals promoted into `autotrade_queue.json`.  
- Queue resides locally on Executor or securely synced.  

---

### 4. Execute (Executor Node)
- **trade_executor.py** reads queue → enforces vault rules + risk fences.  
- Applies persona overlays + flip-mode TTL.  
- Routes intent via broker adapters (equities, options, crypto).  
- Outputs → `open_orders.json`, `trade_log.jsonl`.  

---

### 5. Audit & Replay (Alpha + Markets)
- Append-only logs capture every decision path.  
- Snapshots of inputs/outputs enable full **replay DAGs**.  
- Export-ready for compliance, partners, or forensic review.  

---

### ✅ Why It Matters
- **Deterministic:** no ambiguity; every decision is traceable.  
- **Safe:** vault rules + persona overlays enforce discipline.  
- **Transparent:** regulators/auditors can replay the full chain.  
- **Scalable:** same pipeline runs across multiple vaults and nodes.  

---

## 🎭 Personas & Flip-Mode (Intelligence Overlay)

VANTA’s intelligence layer isn’t just about signals — it’s about **biasing reasoning modes** and **controlling capital overlays**.  
This ensures allocations are explainable, diverse, and resilient.

---

### Personas (Bias Profiles)
- **Athena (Risk-Averse):** favors fundamentals, macro confirmation, wider stop discipline.  
- **Apollo (Aggressive):** leans into momentum, high-conviction flows, shorter horizons.  
- **Ares (Contrarian):** overweights anomaly/mean-reversion cues, thrives on dislocation.  
- **Nemesis (Balancer):** hedges across rails, dampens outlier exposures.  

> 📌 Personas act as **reinforcement layers**, not separate models.  
> They bias conviction vectors and vault allocations in governed, explainable ways.  

---

### Flip-Mode (TTL Overlays)
- **Purpose:** tactical “fast path” for short-lived market edges.  
- **How It Works:**  
  - Manager enables a flip overlay → creates an alternate execution branch.  
  - Parameters: TTL (time-to-live), capital slice, risk knobs.  
  - Auto-reverts after TTL expiry — no indefinite high-risk states.  

---

### Where Applied
- **Reflection (Markets):** signals re-scored under persona or flip overlays for preview.  
- **Execution (Executor):** vault constraints + persona bias directly impact order sizing and routing.  

---

### ✅ Why It Matters
- **Diversity of Thought:** prevents monoculture trading by embedding multiple reasoning lenses.  
- **Governed Risk:** flip-mode TTLs guarantee experiments are bounded and reversible.  
- **Replayable:** overlays are logged, so auditors can see when and why overlays were active.  

---

## 🏦 Vaults, Multi-Vault, and Mirroring (Customer Plane)

At the heart of VANTA is the **vault**: a deterministic, auditable capital container.  
Vaults encode risk rails, allocation logic, persona overlays, and execution rules — all as JSON state machines.  

---

### 🔑 Vaults
- **Capital Envelope:** defines what assets can be traded (equities, options, crypto).  
- **Risk Rails:** max position sizes, stop logic, exposure caps.  
- **Persona Bias:** allocations tuned by Athena, Apollo, Ares, Nemesis overlays.  
- **Compounding Logic:** governs reinvestment, scaling, and roll-forward states.  

---

### 🔗 Multi-Vault
- Portfolios can consist of multiple vaults, e.g.:  
  - *Momentum-US* (short-horizon equities).  
  - *Fundamental-Core* (macro + value tilt).  
  - *Crypto-Flow* (on-chain momentum + whale wallets).  
- Vaults run independently but share governance, replayability, and observability.  

---

### 🌐 Cross-Rail Awareness
Vaults are **rail-agnostic**:  
- A vault may hold both fiat and crypto allocations.  
- Executor routes orders to the appropriate broker (equities/options) or exchange (crypto).  
- Conversion logic ensures deterministic USD ⇄ USDC ⇄ BTC pathways.  

---

### 🤝 Mirroring
VANTA extends vaults outward through **mirroring**:  
- A manager vault emits **sanitized order intents**.  
- Followers mirror these allocations **proportionally or capped** in their own accounts.  
- Execution flows via signed webhooks or broker adapters (HMAC-protected).  
- Custody always stays with the follower — VANTA never touches user capital.  

---

### ✅ Why It Matters
- **Transparency:** every mirrored order ties back to a manager vault intent.  
- **Alignment:** managers and followers succeed together (PnL vs fees logged side by side).  
- **Scalability:** 1 vault can mirror into **1,000+ follower accounts** deterministically.  

---

## 📊 Observability & Ops

VANTA is designed with **resilience-first, audit-first principles**.  
Every signal, allocation, and mirrored order is observable, measurable, and replayable.

---

### 📈 Health Checks
- **Markets Node:** freshness of `*_signals.json` files, last reflection timestamp, and non-zero signal counts.  
- **Executor Node:** delta between order queue ingestion and broker confirmations.  
- **Alpha Node:** assistant and tracker uptime; vault overlay states.  

---

### 📑 Logs
- **Structured JSON:** every action tagged with correlation IDs (`mo_id`, `fo_id`, `follower_id`).  
- **Dedicated Files:**  
  - `reflector_meta.log` (Markets reflection cycle).  
  - `trade_log.jsonl` (Executor orders + fills).  
  - `mirror_dispatch.log` (webhook dispatch + retries).  
- Logs are append-only and rolled daily to object storage.  

---

### 🔍 Tracing
- End-to-end traces from **signal ingestion → conviction → order → broker → confirmation**.  
- Correlation via unique DAG IDs.  
- Visual dashboards (Grafana/Jaeger) enable latency + attribution analysis.  

---

### 📊 Metrics
- `mirror.dispatch.latency_ms` → P50/P95 latency of follower dispatches.  
- `broker.submit.success_rate` → broker adapter confirmation success ratio.  
- `mirror.error.rate` → error rate per vault/follower.  
- `webhook.retry.count` → retry attempts logged per webhook/follower.  

---

### 🛠 Operator Tools
- **CLI:**  
  - `vanta-diagnostics` → prints system health summary.  
  - `tracker_status_summary.py` → module progress snapshot.  
  - `tracker_viewer.py` → HTML board for live review.  
- **Runbooks:**  
  - Toggle maintenance: edit `vault_overlay.json`.  
  - Pause cycles: disable cron or stop systemd units.  
  - NFS check: `showmount -e` on Alpha, `mount | grep vanta` on workers.  

---

### 🎯 Service-Level Objectives (SLOs)
- **Dispatch latency:** manager order → follower dispatch ≤ **2s (P95)**.  
- **Webhook reliability:** success rate ≥ **99.5%** (with retries).  
- **Audit durability:** 11x9s storage reliability across object store.  
- **System uptime:** 99.9% API + mirroring availability.  

---

## 🔌 API & Model Usage

All reasoning and orchestration in VANTA flow through controlled entry points.  
This ensures **no secrets leak**, **all calls are audited**, and **models remain explainable**.

---

### 🔑 Assistant Mediation
- All model interactions run via `vanta_assistant.py` (Alpha).  
- Provides **centralized throttling, redaction, and prompt-guarding**.  
- Prevents direct exposure of OS internals or raw secrets.  

---

### 📡 API Principles
- **Idempotent:** every mutating request requires an `Idempotency-Key`.  
- **Rate-Limited:** gateway enforces 60 RPM baseline per client.  
- **Scoped Access:** JWT scopes ensure least-privilege API usage.  
- **Replayable:** every request + response logged in `audit_events`.  

---

### 🤖 Model Usage
- **Classifiers:** bias detection, signal relevance scoring.  
- **Forecasters:** short/long-horizon attribution (time-series + event-driven).  
- **Anomaly Detectors:** drift detection + outlier spotting.  
- **Graph Embeddings:** connect entities (tickers, wallets, filings, sentiment).  
- **Meta Belief Stacker:** fuses outputs into conviction-ranked vectors.  

All model outputs include:
- **Conviction score (0–1)**  
- **Reason vector (list of factors)**  
- **Persona overlays (Athena, Apollo, Nemesis, etc.)**  
- **Audit pointer (DAG ID)**  

---

### 🔒 Security Guardrails
- **Secrets never in prompts.** Only safe paths, identifiers, or hashes passed.  
- **Broker adapters isolated.** Keys stored outside code in Vault/KMS.  
- **Redaction enforced.** Sensitive context scrubbed before persistence.  

---

### 🧾 Replay & Audit
- Every API call and model decision is tied to a **DAG reference**.  
- Allows regulators, auditors, and operators to **replay the full decision chain**.  
- Guarantees **explainability** for every allocation, trade, or mirrored order.  

---

## 🚀 Deployment & Upgrades

VANTA runs as a **multi-node, containerized stack** designed for high availability, replayability, and rapid iteration.  
Upgrades are always **controlled, reproducible, and reversible**.

---

### 📦 Deployment Model
- **Three-Node Topology**  
  - **Alpha (Control Plane):** orchestration, assistant, tracker, and NFS export of shared artifacts.  
  - **Markets (Ingestion & Reflection):** collectors, reflectors, rerankers, and signal memory.  
  - **Executor (Execution Plane):** brokers, adapters, vault overlays, and trade logs.  

- **Environment Layout**  
  - **Dev:** feature flag testing, permissive configs.  
  - **Staging:** mirrors prod infra with shadow signals.  
  - **Prod:** hardened, drift-monitored, fully auditable.  

---

### 🛠 Upgrade Workflow
- **Golden Artifacts:**  
  - Core tools live on Alpha under `/opt/vanta/build`.  
  - Mounted via NFS by Markets + Executor.  

- **Promotion Steps:**  
  1. Candidate tool/module is staged on Alpha (`/opt/vanta/build/modules/`).  
  2. Reviewed + marked via tracker (`thread_tracker.json`).  
  3. Promoted with `tracker_manager.py` → rsync/NFS export.  
  4. Workers pick up new version automatically on service restart.  

- **Fallback:**  
  - A/B directory convention (`_A`, `_B`) allows instant rollback.  
  - Symlink flip restores prior version in <30s.  

---

### 🔄 Runtime Management
- **systemd Units:**  
  - `markets-reflector.service` → ingestion + reflection cycles.  
  - `executor-router.service` → reads queue + routes broker orders.  
  - `vanta-assistant@.service` → interactive operator session.  

- **Log Rotation:**  
  - `/opt/vanta/logs/*.log` rotated daily, 14-day retention.  
  - Snapshotted into object storage for replay + compliance.  

---

### 🧩 Disaster Recovery
- **Postgres:** point-in-time recovery (PITR).  
- **Redis:** 5-minute snapshot interval, tested restore.  
- **Object Store:** versioned, cross-region replication.  
- **Infra as Code:** Terraform + Helm ensure reproducible builds.  

---

### ✅ Key Principles
- **Controlled:** nothing auto-promoted without tracker approval.  
- **Reproducible:** every upgrade path is scripted + logged.  
- **Reversible:** instant rollback via A/B or snapshot restore.  
- **Auditable:** all changes tied to tracker + operator signatures.  

---

## 🛡️ Risk Controls (Live-Money Discipline)

VANTA enforces **hard risk fences** across ingestion, execution, and vault overlays.  
These controls ensure that no signal, model, or operator bypasses governance.

---

### ⚡ Pre-Trade Controls
- **Exposure Caps:** max % of NAV per ticker, sector, or asset class.  
- **Concurrency Limits:** max open orders per vault and per broker.  
- **Liquidity Filters:** only trade assets above configurable ADV/liquidity thresholds.  
- **Persona Bias Enforcement:** risk-averse personas auto-downsize sizing or extend holding horizons.  

---

### 🔄 In-Flight Controls
- **Kill Switches:**  
  - `vault_overlay.json → { "maintenance": true }` halts all new orders instantly.  
  - Follower-level kill switch disables mirroring for a single account.  
- **Stop Logic:** persona-specific stop losses + trailing exits.  
- **Flip-Mode TTL:** fast-path overlays expire automatically (30–60 min default).  

---

### 📊 Post-Trade Controls
- **PnL Attribution:** every order tagged with conviction band + persona overlay.  
- **Daily Sanity Checks:** NAV vs benchmarks logged and validated.  
- **Replay Audits:** complete decision DAG (signal → trade → fill → PnL) can be replayed.  

---

### ✅ Why It Matters
- **Capital Safety:** no trade bypasses pre-trade or in-flight fences.  
- **Alignment:** personas + overlays enforce strategy discipline automatically.  
- **Auditability:** regulators or partners can reconstruct *exactly why* any trade happened.  

---

## 🧰 Command Cheats (Operator Shortcuts)

VANTA ships with a **command-layer toolkit** for operators.  
These are already installed on nodes (Alpha, Markets, Executor) for faster workflows.

---

### 🔹 Assistant & Diagnostics
- `vanta-assistant` → interactive GPT-like ops agent (Alpha).  
- `vanta-diagnostics` → system summary (any node).  

---

### 🔹 Thread Ops
- `vt-add` → create new thread entry.  
- `vt-list` → list active threads.  
- `vt-mark` → mark thread as resolved or escalated.  
- `vt-note` → append operator notes.  
- `vt-open` → open thread context for review.  

---

### 🔹 Status & Tracking
- `python3 /opt/vanta/alpha/tracker_status_summary.py` → system status view.  
- `python3 /opt/vanta/alpha/tracker_viewer.py` → HTML dashboard render.  

---

### ✅ Why It Matters
These shortcuts let operators **audit, pause, or update** system state without digging through raw JSON or logs.  
They act as the **human-in-the-loop layer** — keeping VANTA governed and explainable.

---

## 📐 Diagram Hints (Architecture Visualization)

While VANTA does not expose diagrams directly in this repository, the architecture can be visualized conceptually for clarity.  
These are **safe-to-share abstractions** that highlight orchestration without exposing credentials or sensitive configs.

---

### 🔹 OS Pipeline (Conceptual Flow)
- **Ingestion Layer** → Reddit Stealth, Twitter Stealth, SEC Scraper, News, Crypto feeds.  
- **Processing Layer** → Deduplication, normalization, temporal alignment.  
- **Entity Resolution** → Insiders, tickers, wallets, chatter IDs mapped into canonical graph.  
- **Feature Stores** → Offline (Parquet/S3) + Online (Redis) for low-latency retrieval.  
- **Model Ensemble** → Classifiers, forecasters, anomaly detectors, graph embeddings.  
- **Conviction Scorer** → Ranked conviction vectors with reason metadata.  
- **Execution Router** → Brokers, exchanges, vault governance enforcement.  
- **Audit Harness** → Replayable DAGs, append-only logs, compliance-ready.

### 🔹 Three-Node Topology
- **Alpha Node (Orchestrator / Brain)**  
  - Assistant, tracker, control plane.  
  - Exports shared artifacts via secure mounts.  

- **Markets Node (Harvest & Reflection)**  
  - Collectors, reflection engines, rerankers.  
  - Writes enriched signals into memory and feeds the OS pipeline.  

- **Executor Node (Execution Plane)**  
  - Trade execution, broker adapters, PnL attribution.  
  - Enforces vault overlays and persona constraints.  

---

### 🔹 Attachments & Overlays
- **Personas** → Aggressive, Safe, Contrarian overlays bias reasoning and allocations.  
- **Flip Mode** → Short-TTL alternate execution path with amplifier logic.  
- **Vaults** → Capital containers encoded as JSON with compounding + guardrails.  
- **Cross-Rail Awareness** → Seamless routing across fiat and crypto rails.

### ✅ Why It Matters
These conceptual diagrams help others understand **how VANTA is orchestrated**:  
a governed, replayable capital OS with separation of concerns (ingest, reflect, execute) and **institutional-grade overlays** (personas, vaults, flip mode).

---

## 🚀 Why This Is From the Future

VANTA is not another trading tool, dashboard, or bot.  
It is a **governed capital operating system** that encodes how capital should think, act, and govern itself — in real time.

### 🔑 What Makes It Different
- **Belief-Stacked Reasoning** → every allocation comes with explainable conviction vectors, not black-box scores.  
- **Replayable Decisions** → every order can be reconstructed from raw signals through to execution.  
- **Persona Overlays** → allocations are shaped by risk-aware profiles (Athena, Apollo, Nemesis, Contrarian) that bias reasoning, not marketing.  
- **Flip Mode** → tactical, short-TTL branches for opportunistic edges without breaking governance.  
- **Cross-Rail Capital** → fiat, stablecoins, and crypto treated as a single continuous canvas.  
- **Vault Model** → allocations encoded as deterministic JSON envelopes, enforceable and auditable.  

### ⚖️ Separation of Concerns
- **OS Layer** → the brain (collect, reason, allocate, execute, audit).  
- **Platform Layer** → the product (subscriptions, mirroring, APIs, entitlements).  
- Together: **a closed-loop intelligence stack** that scales from one vault to thousands of mirrored accounts — safely, transparently, and autonomously.  

### 🧠 Operator-Centric
VANTA is not “AI replaces humans.”  
It is **AI governed by humans** — operators set rails, personas, caps, and overlays.  
The system guarantees replayability, immutability, and guardrails so **capital autonomy is trusted at scale.**

### 💡 The Takeaway
This is **how future funds will run**:  
- No 20-person quant desk.  
- No $5M vendor spend.  
- No screenshots, no signal sales.  
- Just one governed, replayable, persona-reinforced OS.  

⚡ Faster.  
💰 Cheaper.  
🔒 Safer.  
🧠 Smarter.
